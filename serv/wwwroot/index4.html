                        <p>New technology is changing how we look at (and in) eyeglasses. Thanks tThese reflex-inducing illusions are offered up by the Varjo XR-3 (the “XR” is for “extended reality,” a broad industry term to span both VR and digital objects in physical reality). The headset has largely achieved Finnish startup Varjo’s goal of producing virtual worlds and objects rendered at the resolution of human vision.These reflex-inducing illusions are offered up by the Varjo XR-3 (the “XR” is for “extended reality,” a broad industry term to span both VR and digital objects in physical reality).

The headset has largely achieved Finnish startup Varjo’s goal of producing virtual worlds and objects rendered at the resolution of human vision.o 3-D face-scanning machines, eyewear can now be custom measured within .01 millimeter. As a result, the glasses of the future are perfectly tailored to fit every unique contour of a person’s face — a very welcome change for those who exercise with eyewear. And in addition to being more accurate, it takes less than a minute to complete a scan, which makes it more efficient than those manual fittings.</p>

                    <p>Although this new technology is currently at a premium, vision insurance is very affordable — typically, less than your medical premium, which is a small price to pay for maintaining eye health. Additionally, insurance will cover a portion of the cost of glasses and/or contacts. Upgrade your eyewear in March and save even more with a special Visionworks lens upgrade promotion from Independence Blue Cross for Save Your Vision Month.</p>
